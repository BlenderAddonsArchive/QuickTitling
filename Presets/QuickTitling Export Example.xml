<preset>
    <description>This is an example of the import and export format for QuickTitling presets.  Note that in an actual preset file, the description and name values do not need to be set, they are simply for the benefit of understanding the file.  Any value may be left out, the default value will be used.  Add multiple objects tags to add multiple objects to your title.  Add multiple animations tags to add multiple animations to your objects.</description>
